This program is to characterize HIV protease (HIVP) sequences. It is integrated with ProteinBERT to predict whether a strain of HIV with protease mutations is resistant or susceptible to FDA approved HIVP inhibitors. Here we include 5 drugs: indinavir (IDV), saquinavir (SQV), nelfinavir (NFV), amprenavir (APV) and lopinavir (LPV), and the prediction accuracy is >95%. This program can thus be practically used to select the most effective treatment strategies for AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) patients based on their individual HIVP mutation profiles.
